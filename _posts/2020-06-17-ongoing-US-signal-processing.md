Signal processing has been at the core of communication technology. Today it continues to drive technology innovations for 5G/6G and beyond.

This brief survey highlights recent progress on topics in wireless signal processing (SP) research, mainly in the areas of communication and sensing. It provides historical context and outlook in connection to Futurewei research efforts where applicable.

Rather than duplicating the many survey papers on established trends, we single out nuggets of cross-domain analytical formulations and mathematical tools to comment on. As foundational building-block concepts and tools, we believe they hold promise for next-generation communication and sensing breakthroughs.

Surveys like this aim to stimulate open collaboration on early-stage fundamental research efforts, in which Futurewei Wireless Research actively participates, as they often lead to successful commercial rollouts many years down the road, as epitomized by, e.g. massive MIMO study that led to successful 5G deployments a decade later.  Understanding the academic directions will help us also coordinate our efforts in terms of directions and where important leadership might lie.

We spotlight the following topics.
•‘Physical’ Theory of Information
•	High-Dimensional Signal Processing
•	A New Problem in Sensing
•	Online Algorithm
•	New Problems in URLLC
•	One-Bit Array
•	Inexpensive Large Surface?

References are chosen sparingly; insofar as only essential original contributions are concerned.
